Twitter seems to be getting more popular and I myself have found myself delving into the api's a few times already.
Simple enough - as per the MOD title, this MOD allows you to tweet this topic or post. If you're not logged in when you click the link, simply log in and you'll redirected with the tweet still kept (not done by me, you can thank twitter devs for that).
